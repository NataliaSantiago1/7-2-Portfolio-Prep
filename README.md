The proprietor of DriverPass desires to create a website for driver education.  According to the proprietor, a large number of students are failing driving because they are not receiving the necessary instruction. The customer, who owns Driver Pass, wants a system designed that allows student drivers to sign up for driving instruction. They want us to construct a system that allows customers to choose driving packages and create their own accounts. The users will have access to online courses, online assessments, and on-the-road training.  All of the employee and student accounts will be accessible to the owner.

I believe I did a good job of designing the needs for this system.  The designing requirements required a great deal of careful work and are an essential phase in the creation of this product.

Since the functional and non-functional needs are an essential component of the project and are subject to change as it progresses, I would focus on them.  To ensure that it never changes, I would like to be able to make it a little more stable.  Getting input from employers and students would be how I would enhance this.  The most useful feedback comes from people who are really utilizing the software.

I wanted to confirm that I had addressed every request that was made of us.  To make things easier to work with, I wanted to make sure I had each component of the requirements—the client, the student, the owner, and the employees—separate.  The needs of the client are crucial because the project won't be beneficial to them if the specifications aren't met.  In essence, we could not have finished the project without the specifications.

I would want to obtain the specifications for the new system functionalities before beginning to create the program.  Once the system was designed, I would incorporate the additional functionality. In order to examine in the future, I would like input.  After receiving the input, I wanted to think about the limitations of the system.  I could then start working on any modifications or improvements that would make the system function better.
